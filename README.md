Physics demo by Josh Widjaja
Experience requirements:
- **The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player**: Mouse to advance pages, some objects can be dragged
- **The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact)**: Satisfied
- **3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass)**: 3 scenes that extend PhysicsMap
- **Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes**: Pages and ending scene
